  <b>OpenOcta</b> — An open‑source, enterprise‑grade agent built for operations
</p>

> For the Chinese version, see `README.md`.  
> 中文说明请见 `README.md`。

OpenOcta takes design cues from [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openocta/openocta) and is **fully reimplemented** as a **single Go backend binary with an embedded frontend**, aimed at operations, observability, and automation workloads.

---

## Project overview

- **Positioning**: Acts inside the enterprise as an **observability & operations hub**, unifying monitoring, logs, configuration, CMDB, tickets, and similar data sources so the Agent can help with troubleshooting, analysis, and decisions.
- **Form factor**: One binary that ships Gateway, Agent, Channels, Cron, and the embedded Control UI static assets; integrate via CLI, HTTP/WebSocket, and Webhooks.
- **Protocol compatibility**: Compatible with the OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket protocol and official Control UI behavior, so you can migrate from or run alongside OpenClaw.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- **Go 1.24+** (build the backend)
- **Node ≥18** (frontend build only; not needed in production)
- Environment variable **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** (required when using the `agent` command)

### Build and run the Gateway

```bash
# Build (Makefile recommended)
make build

# Or use the helper script
./build.sh build   # supports: ui | embed | go | build | clean | snapshot | release | docker

# Start the Gateway
make run
# or
./openocta gateway run
```

By default the Gateway listens on `http://127.0.0.1:18900`; HTTP and WebSocket share the same port. The **frontend is embedded with `go:embed`**, so open that URL in a browser to use the Control UI.

### Dev mode (frontend hot reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Gateway (build once first)
./openocta gateway run

# Terminal 2: frontend dev server (port 5173)
make run-ui
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to debug the frontend with hot reload.

### Agent CLI

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
./openocta agent -m "Hello, echo test"
```

### Configuration

On first run, if no config file exists, OpenOcta seeds one from the embedded `openocta.json.example` into:

| Platform      | Default path                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Linux / macOS | `~/.openocta/openocta.json`        |
| Windows       | `%APPDATA%\openocta\openocta.json` |

### macOS desktop install (.dmg)

- **`.dmg`**: Mounts a **read-only** volume under **`/Volumes/...`**. Drag the app to **Applications** or use the in-app install prompt so it lands at **`/Applications/OpenOcta.app`**. Do not treat `/Volumes/...` as the installed copy—**eject** the disk image in Finder. See `deploy/dist-README.md`.

- **Backend**: Go 1.24+, Gateway HTTP + WebSocket, Agent, Channels, Cron, config, and related services.
- **Frontend**: Control UI is **embedded via `go:embed`** in the single binary; no separate frontend deployment in production.
- **Single binary**: The built `openocta` ships the UI and config templates and can be distributed and run as‑is.
